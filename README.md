# LocationBasedAlarm
Mobile app which would warn you while travellin on bus/train when you are close to destination

The application used On{X} platform.

The user needs to setup the latitude & longitude of the destination and once you are close to it you'd get a message.

I wrote this because I often lost track of time reading news/book on buses/trains. I'd setup the GPS location of the stop right before my destinations, so I do not need to hurry when my destination is reached.
